\usage{
.raster_timestamp(raster, days, months, years, path, file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster}{A SpatRaster object to be processed.}

\item{days}{Vector of days (numeric or character) used to build the date vector.}

\item{months}{Vector of months (numeric or character).}

\item{years}{Vector of years (numeric or character).}

\item{path}{Directory where the raster file is stored.}

\item{file_path}{Full file path to the raster file that will be replaced.}
}
\value{
The input SpatRaster with its time dimension updated. On disk, the original
file is replaced by the new file with time information.
}
\description{
This function takes a SpatRaster object and a set of days, months, and years,
constructs a valid date vector, assigns it as the raster's time dimension,
writes the raster to a temporary NetCDF file using terra::writeCDF, removes the
original file, and renames the temporary file to the original file path.
