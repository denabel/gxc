# gxc: Easy access to Earth observation data 🌏

## Description

For many researchers in the social sciences, **Earth observation (EO)**
data represents a black box. Social science researchers face many
obstacles in applying and using these data, resulting from 1) a lack of
technical expertise, 2) a lack of knowledge of data sources and how to
access them, 3) unfamiliarity with complex data formats, such as
high-resolution, longitudinal raster datacubes, and 4) lack of expertise
in integrating the data into existing social science datasets. **`gxc`**
aims to close the gap by creating an automated interface to EO data and
complementary resources for social science research.

The project’s core is creating an **open-source tool** to link **time-
and space-sensitive** social science datasets with data from Earth
observation programs. Detailed documentation and beginner-friendly
tutorials complement the tool to showcase the capability of our project.
The social science community is the main target group of our tool. At
the same time, Earth system science researchers may similarly profit
from it. This project supports inter- and transdisciplinary research
which is often made difficult because of technical, disciplinary, and
organizational barriers. The project emphasizes research data management
(RDM) workflows based on **FAIR data** and **Open Science** principles.
Please visit our [**online
compendium**](https://denabel.github.io/gxc_pages/) for the detailed
documentation, overview of indicators and training material.

The unique feature of the tool is the possibility of carrying out both
geographically and temporally high-resolution queries of data from
**Copernicus Data Services** and other Earth observation data sources,
which at the same time function efficiently on simple workstations
albeit larger amounts of data. Our workflow development has identified
five major levers: **indicator type**, **indicator intensity**, **focal
time period**, **baseline time period**, and **spatial buffer**.
Flexibility on these five attributes should be maximized for users.
Thus, the tool offers the functionality to automatically derive
**spatio-temporal links** with other georeferenced data typically used
in the social sciences, like surveys, digital behavioral data or
socio-economic indicators.

Users benefit from a **curated core** of EO variables which are most
relevant for social science research. For now, **`gxc`** is primarily
focused on **weather and climate indicators**. Additional variables on
**local air quality**, **greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)**, and **land
cover and use** will be integrated in the near term. The main data
providers are the **Copernicus Monitoring Services on Climate Change,
Atmosphere, and Land**. For an up-to-date list of all integrated data
sources and variables, please visit our [indicator
catalogue](https://denabel.github.io/gxc_pages/catalogue.html).

Europe’s Earth Observation programme is called
[Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en). It is funded and managed by
the European Commission and partners like the [European Space
Agency](https://www.esa.int/) (ESA) and the [European Organisation for
the Exploitation of Meteorological
Satellites](https://www.eumetsat.int/) (EUMETSAT). It has been
operational since 2014 and provides free and open access to a wealth of
satellite data from ESA’s “Sentinel” fleet. Copernicus combines data
from satellites, ground-based as well as air- and sea-borne sensors to
track the Earth system and provide this information largely free for all
customers.

The ESA describes Copernicus as the world’s most ambitious Earth
observation program, which will be further expanded in the coming years.
On the [Copernicus homepage](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data.),
the daily data collection is estimated at 12 terabytes. Given the
complexity of issues, Copernicus has separated its services for public
usage along several thematic areas:

- **Atmosphere**: [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring
  Service](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/) (CAMS)
- **Marine**: [Copernicus Marine Service](https://marine.copernicus.eu/)
  (CMEMS)
- **Land**: [Copernicus Land Monitoring
  Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/en) (CLMS)
- **Climate change**: [Copernicus Climate Change
  Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) (C3S)
- **Emergency**: [Copernicus Emergency Management
  Service](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/) (CEMS).

## Keywords

transdisciplinary research

## Use Cases

There are several major research topics in the social sciences which
benefit from the integration of EO data:

1.  **Environmental social sciences** 🌱,
2.  **Conflict and peace research** 🕊,
3.  **Political attitudes and behavior** 🗳,
4.  **Policy studies** 📜,
5.  **Economic development and inequality** 📈, and
6.  **Public health** 💪.

The **environmental social sciences** are a growing research field at
the intersection between the Earth system and societies. One particular
topic, the role of extreme weather events for people’s environmental
attitudes and behavior, has especially benefited from a growing
availability of EO data. A noteworthy study by [Hoffmann et
al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-021-01263-8), for example,
analyses how the experience of climate anomalies and extremes influences
environmental attitudes and vote intention in Europe by integrating
**climatological, survey, and parliamentary data**.

**Digital behavioral data**, like posts on social media, online-search
behavior and other forms of digital traces are increasingly
georeferenced and/or include references to points of interest (POI).
Having access to this location data advances the opportunities for
linking these data points to EO indicators. “People as sensors” is
increasingly popular in the social sciences to understand
human-environment interactions. An early study by [Kirilenko et
al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.11.003)
investigates the relationship between temperature anomalies and tweets
on climate change in the US. In the following years, the state of
research was expanded to include case studies on Spain ([Mumenthaler et
al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102286)) and the UK
([Young et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-82384-w)), among
others.

Beyond environmental social sciences, there are other fields which
benefit from EO data. Economists and social scientists who study
**economic development and inequality** exploit EO data in various forms
to operationalize independent variables such as drivers and barriers to
development (e.g. droughts) as well as dependent variables (e.g. night
lights as proxies for economic activity or the quality of rooftops as
development indicator). [García-León et
al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26050-z), for example,
investigate historical and future economic impacts of recent heatwaves
in Europe and [Jean et
al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf7894) show how nighttime
maps can be utilized as estimates of household consumption and assets.

## Input Data

The input data format depends on the selected function:

- **`point_link_`** functions: spatial point objects (`sf`),
- **`poly_link_`** functions: spatial polygon or multipolygon objects
  (`sf`),
- **`grid_link_`** functions: gridded raster files (`SpatRaster`).

## Output Data

In general, output files will have the same format as the input files.
Indicator values are added as additional variables to `sf` objects and
as additional layers to `SpatRaster` objects. When spatial buffer are
specified for point data, the `sf`-output file contains polygons. The
link-functions will perform reprojections of the CRS (for example for
buffer-calculation). These will be displayed in the progress bar. In
general, we advice you to assign the data output to a new object (like
`dataset_out` in our examples below).

The figure below visualizes how the selected EO indicator will be
processed based on the different input formats.

## Hardware Requirements

`gxc` is meant to function efficiently on simple workstations. However,
if you have access to a cluster environment, you can set up a
cluster-plan with the `future`-package.

## Environment Setup

### Installation instructions- development release

To install the package from github:

``` r
# if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}
# remotes::install_github("denabel/gxc")
# library(gxc)
```

### API Access

The new system of data stores of the Copernicus services have simplified
access for users. With a user-account with the [European Center for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/), most
indicators from the Copernicus services are retrievable. In particular,
this account grants access to the
[Climate](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/),
[Atmosphere](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/), [Early
Warning](https://ewds.climate.copernicus.eu/) data stores.

To use most `gxc` functions, you need an ECMWF-account. Please ensure
you follow their Terms and Conditions.

In order to access the Copernicus data services, we integrate the
[ecmwfr](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/ecmwfr)-package into `gxc`.
Many thanks to the authors and developers of this awesome package.
Please revise their description of usage and setup.

### Parallel processing

`gxc` follows the parallel computing paradigm of the `future` package.
By default, this is disabled and the data will be processed through a
“standard” sequential pipeline. However, users can enable parallel
processing in all major functions (`parallel = TRUE`). This can
significantly increase execution time of processes which use large
datasets. In our functions, parallel computing becomes especially
relevant when observations are linked with EO data based on varying
focal time periods. At the same time, setting up a parallel plan and
chunk-based processing generates an overhead which could lead to
performance decreases compared to sequential approaches. This is
especially true for smaller datasets with narrower spatial extent and
fewer observations. Check out our [performance
website](https://denabel.github.io/gxc_pages/performance.html) to find
out, whether it makes sense to enable parallel processing for your
dataset.

If `parallel=TRUE`, data processing is performed by pre-chunking input
data. The chunk sizes can be varied with `chunk_size=`. The default is
set to `50`.

### R Version

This package requires R version 4.2.0 or higher.

### Dependencies

All necessary package dependencies are listed in the DESCRIPTION file.
Key dependencies include:

- **sf** (for handling spatial vector data),
- **terra** (for raster data processing),
- **dplyr** (for data manipulation),
- **lubridate** (for date/time processing),
- **keyring** (for secure key management),
- **ecmwfr** (for interacting with the CDS API),
- **future.apply** (for parallel processing),
- **progressr** (for progress reporting).

## How to Use

### Example 1: Retrieving daily temperature for point data

In this first example, we show how to utilize the
`point_link_daily`-function from the `gxc`-package to integrate
temperature data from ERA5 reanalysis for a set of spatial points. Let’s
assume we have a series of georeferenced social media posts on climate
change and we would like to understand how these are associated with
temperature patterns at the person’s location.

### Package setup

We need some packages to load and prepare the world map
(`rnaturalearth`, `sf`, and `tidyverse`). We also need the
`keyring`-package to safely store our API key. Finally, we need
`devtools` to load the `gxc`-package.

``` r
# Install and load required packages
required_packages <- c("devtools", "keyring", "rnaturalearth", "sf", "tidyverse")
new_packages <- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)
lapply(required_packages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# Load gxc package
library(gxc)
```

### Create sample point data

Let’s assume we have a sample of social media posts across Germany
covering the time period from July to August 2019. We would like to
extend this dataset with temperature data from the specific day of the
content post. We create a sample of random points based on a shapefile
for Germany and add random day variables for the field period.

``` r
# Get Germany's boundary as an sf object
germany <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", country = "Germany", returnclass = "sf")

# Generate 1000 random points within Germany's boundary
random_points <- st_sample(germany, size = 1000)

# Convert to an sf object with proper geometry column
points_sf <- st_sf(geometry = random_points)

# Random date within day, month and year limits of field period
set.seed(123)
months <- c("7", "8")
years <- c("2019")
days <- 1:31
n <- nrow(points_sf)
points_sf$date_raw <- paste0(sample(years, n, replace = TRUE), "-",
                         sample(months, n, replace = TRUE), "-",
                         sample(days, n, replace = TRUE)
                         )
```

### Store your API-key

A final setting before we can access the `point_link_daily`-function is
to store our API key. By setting it to “wf_api_key”, the function
automatically retrieves the key.

``` r
api_key <- Sys.getenv("WF_API_KEY")

keyring::key_set_with_value(service = "wf_api_key", password = api_key)
```

### Run function

Check out vignette for `point_link_daily` for detailed documentation.

``` r
# ?point_link_daily
```

Here, we would like to retrieve the daily maximum temperature
(`statistic = "daily_maximum`) for the specific interview day
(`time_span = 0` and `time_lag = 0`) in a 10km area around the
respondents location (`buffer = 10`).

``` r
dataset_out <- point_link_daily(
  indicator = "2m_temperature",
  data = points_sf,
  date_var = "date_raw",
  time_span = 0,
  time_lag = 0,
  buffer = 10,
  baseline = FALSE,
  order = "ymd",
  path = "./data/raw",
  catalogue = "derived-era5-land-daily-statistics",
  statistic = "daily_maximum",
  time_zone = "utc+00:00",
  keep_raw = FALSE,
  parallel = FALSE,
  chunk_size = 50
)
```

### Explore the extended dataset

We can see that the function has added additional columns on the linking
dates, and the actual values (in Kelvin), averaged across the buffer
zone.

``` r
head(dataset_out)
```

### Example 2: Retrieving monthly averaged precipitation for countries

In this example, we show how to utilize the `poly_link_monthly`-function
from the `gxc`-package to integrate precipitation data from the ERA5
reanalysis across countries and for a specific point in time. We will
enable parallel processing.

### Package setup

We need some packages to load and prepare the world map
(`rnaturalearth`, `sf`, `future`, and `tidyverse`). We also need the
`keyring`-package to safely store our API key. Finally, we need
`devtools` to load the `gxc`-package.

``` r
# Install and load required packages
required_packages <- c("devtools", "keyring", "rnaturalearth", "sf", "tidyverse", "future", "future.apply")
new_packages <- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)
lapply(required_packages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# Load gxc package
library(gxc)
```

### Load a world map

Let’s assume we require global precipitation data for October 2014. We
load the shapefile containing country-level polygons, subset it to the
most relevant variables, and add a time variable.

``` r
# Download world map data
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
st_geometry(world)
```

    ## Geometry set for 242 features 
    ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON
    ## Dimension:     XY
    ## Bounding box:  xmin: -180 ymin: -89.99893 xmax: 180 ymax: 83.59961
    ## Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84

    ## MULTIPOLYGON (((-60.82119 9.138379, -60.94141 9...

``` r
# Subset to relevant variables
world <- world |> 
  select(admin, iso_a3, postal, geometry)

# Create fixed date-variable
world$date_raw <- "08-2014"

# Plot world map
plot(world[1])
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/map-1.png)<!-- -->

### Store your API-key

A final setting before we can access the `poly_link_monthly`-function is
to store our API key. By setting it to “wf_api_key”, the function
automatically retrieves the key.

``` r
api_key <- Sys.getenv("WF_API_KEY")

keyring::key_set_with_value(service = "wf_api_key", password = api_key)
```

### Parallel processing

We also set up a multisession with the `future`-package. We select six
workers (rule of thumb: maximum number of cores - 1).

``` r
future::plan(multisession, workers = 6)
```

### Run `poly_link_monthly` function

Check out vignette for `poly_link_monthly` for detailed documentation.

``` r
# ?poly_link_monthly
```

We want to directly retrieve the averaged total precipitation data for
August 2014 (`time_span = 0` and `time_lag = 0`). We furthermore enable
parallel processing (`parallel = TRUE`) and rely on the default chunk
size (`chunk_size = 50`).

``` r
dataset_out <- poly_link_monthly(
  indicator = "total_precipitation",
  data = world,
  date_var = "date_raw",
  time_span = 0,
  time_lag = 0,
  baseline = FALSE,
  order = "my",
  path = "./data/raw",
  catalogue = "reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means",
  by_hour = FALSE,
  keep_raw = FALSE,
  parallel = TRUE,
  chunk_size = 50
  )

# Set back to sequential plan
future::plan(sequential)
```

### Explore the extended dataset

We can see that the function has added additional columns on the linking
dates, and the actual values, averaged across countries.
